### Developer 3

The <a href="http://cla.umn.edu">College of Liberal Arts</a> is the largest college of the University, with over 16,000 students and more than 40 departments.

The LATIS Software Development Team is a group of developers with broad technical skills that are responsible for designing and maintaining web applications to support the research, instructional and administrative mission of the college. We provide consulting, design, architecture, programming, training and maintenance services for a wide variety of projects.

We're looking for a "Dev 3" to join our team.  A "developer 3" in University lingo is a tech lead or senior developer.  Day to day, that involves everything from working as a technology consultant on a working group to doing deep design and planning on largescale systems.  We also work to connect our developers directly with faculty and other researchers, according to shared interests, to help further the teaching and research mission of the college. 

## Values

LATIS Software Development is a tight-knit team that is deeply integrated with the operations of LATIS and the College of Liberal Arts.  LATIS exists to elevate liberal arts teaching, learning, and research.  We do that by:

- Challenging the Status Quo
- Linking and Extending - building new partnerships and making connections
- Bringing Order to Chaos - seeking to proactively address the needs of the College

## Benefits

Working at the University is pretty remarkable.  We offer a very strong <a href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits">benefits</a> package, including tuition subsidies.  You also get to work in an extremely dynamic and exciting environment, working with people who spend every day working to make the world a better, healthier, and safer place.

Salary for this job is between $xx,000 and $xx,000.

## Interviews

We use three interviews. In the first you'll meet with a small group of employees from LATIS and our partner organizations to discuss the job, your previous experience, and your qualifications. The first interview can be done remotely. This interview takes about 60 minutes.

The second interview is a take home design and architecture project, followed by a discussion (in person or remote). The take home work will be time boxed (to just a few hours) and scheduled around your work and family needs.  The discussion takes 30-60 minutes.  This is a chance for you to show us how you approach development and the development workflow.  It's not a "write a bubble sort in a language you've never heard of" sort of experience. 

In the third interview, you'll chat with our CIO about LATIS and your interest in the mission. 

## How to apply

To apply for the job, you'll need to use the University job application system.  It's not the most user-friendly process, so please check the <a href="http://humanresources.umn.edu/find-job/using-employment-system">Using the Job Application System</a> page or get in touch if you run into problems.  You'll need a resume and a cover letter, along with references.  (References don't need to be just a former supervisor or boss - co-workers, members of groups you're involved with, etc are all fine).

The cover letter is a chance for you to tell us about your background, and how your experiences would make the College of Liberal Arts a good home for you.  We're more interested in your passions, problem solving, and personality than a list of technologies.

# Educational Technologies Consultant #

The [College of Liberal Arts](http://cla.umn.edu/) is the largest college at the University of Minnesota, with over 16,000 students and more than 40 departments.  LATIS is the College’s technology organization, and focuses on providing in-depth, high level support to faculty, students and staff on research and academic needs.  

The LATIS Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) Team is a group of academic technologists with experience and expertise in the use of technology to support and amplify teaching, student learning, and scholarship. We provide a wide range of services to the College: one-on-one support to faculty, departmental and college-wide workshops, course- and program-level consultation, and beyond.

We’re looking for an Educational Technologies Consultant (an “Academic Technologist 3 (AT 3)” in University parlance) to join our team. AT 3’s serve as experts to CLA faculty in utilizing technology effectively in teaching and learning. Day-to-day, that involves collaborating with faculty to help them effectively use Canvas and other technologies in their onground and online courses. It also means supporting projects and initiatives in the College that improve learning and support the College mission. 

## Values ##

TEL is a tight-knit team that is deeply integrated with the operations of LATIS and the College of Liberal Arts. LATIS exists to elevate liberal arts teaching, learning, and research. We do that by:

* Challenging the Status Quo
* Linking and Extending - building new partnerships and making connections
* Bringing Order to Chaos - seeking to proactively address the needs of the College

## Benefits ##

Working at the University is pretty remarkable. We offer a very strong [benefits](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits) package, including tuition subsidies, and generous retirement and healthcare benefits. You also get to work in an extremely dynamic and exciting environment, working with people who spend every day working to make the world a better, healthier, and safer place.. 

## Interviews ##
We will use two rounds of interviews. In the first interview, you will meet online with the TEL team and members of LATIS and our partner organizations around campus to discuss the role, your previous experience, and your qualifications. This interview takes about 45 minutes.

In the second interview, you will come to campus to meet with the TEL team to give a brief presentation about an experience, project, or skill that would support the mission of LATIS and the College. You will also meet with the TEL Team Coordinator, the Director of Enhancing Learning, and the LATIS CIO to learn more about LATIS and discuss your interest in the mission of the College. This second round will take approximately 2 to 2.5 hours.

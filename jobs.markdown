# Software Developer 3 #

The [College of Liberal Arts](http://cla.umn.edu/) is the largest college at the University of Minnesota, with over 16,000 students and more than 40 departments.  LATIS is the College’s technology organization, and focuses on providing in-depth, high level support to faculty, students and staff on research and academic needs.  

We're looking for a "Dev 3" to join our team.  A "developer 3" in University lingo is a tech lead or senior developer.  Day to day, that involves everything from working as a technology consultant on a working group to doing deep design and planning on large-scale systems.  We also work to connect our developers directly with faculty and other researchers, according to shared interests, to help further the teaching and research mission of the college. 

You'll work with the LATIS Technology Architect and members of the three LATIS units (Enhancing Learning, Advancing Research, Improving Process) to build new tools, support existing needs, and consult with members of our college.  You'll also help chart the technological course for LATIS development.  We work on everything from small scale prototypes to enterprise-critical systems, using a wide range of technologies including Ruby on Rails, PHP (Laravel), NodeJS, Python, Unity, React and VueJS.  

Some examples of our products include:
* [z.umn.edu](http://z.umn.edu), the University's URL shortener
* [LangTest](http://langtest.cla.umn.edu), the onboarding and management of the CLA Language Requirement
* [ChimeIn](http://chimein2.cla.umn.edu), a realtime student response (clicker) tool
* [Elevator](http://www.elevatorapp.net), our AWS-based digital asset management platform
* [TandemPlus](http://tandem.umn.edu), a tool for facilitating language practice

Some upcoming projects for this role include:
* A new tool to help students keep track of their career planning progress and next steps
* Enhancements to a group management tool to track committee and role memberships
* Repacking and expanding on supporting materials for our open source projects

## Values ##

LATIS exists to elevate liberal arts teaching, learning, and research. We do that by:

* Challenging the Status Quo
* Linking and Extending - building new partnerships and making connections
* Bringing Order to Chaos - seeking to proactively address the needs of the College

## Benefits ##

Working at the University is pretty remarkable. We offer a very strong [benefits](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits) package, including tuition subsidies, and generous retirement and healthcare benefits. You also get to work in an extremely dynamic and exciting environment, working with people who spend every day working to make the world a better, healthier, and safer place.

## Interviews ##
We will use two rounds of interviews. In the first interview, you will meet online with the members of LATIS and our partner organizations around campus to discuss the role, your previous experience, and your qualifications. This interview takes about 45 minutes.

In the second interview, you will come to campus to meet with the LATIS technology architect and LATIS CIO to learn more about LATIS and discuss your interest in the mission of the College. This second round will take approximately 1 hour.
